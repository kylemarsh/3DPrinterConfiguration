1. Set my Z=0 accurately. Start in DWC console with M561 to
turn off any mesh compensation. Then M208 S1 Z-3. Then step
the nozzle all the way down to the bed and use a thin as
possible sheet of paper to set Z=0. You want the nozzle to
just barely drag the paper. Send G92 Z0 to set Z=0

2. Set my probe trigger height. Move the head up 5 mm (G1 Z5)
then send G30 S-1. The console will display the trigger Z
height. Repeat 2-3 times and average the Z value. Put that
value in for the Z value of G31 in config.g. This will prompt
a restart, do it.

(at this point you can delete config-override.g and
heightmap.csv and run the _First_Probe macro instead)

3. Auto Calibration. Send G32 via console. Let the calibration
finish and repeat 2-4 times until the deviations converge.
M500 to save.

4. Mesh Bed, optional, and I don’t usually use it. You can send
a G29 via console to run a detailed z probe that will create
your height map to be used in mesh compensation. If you don’t
want to use mesh bed (try it without it first) then make sure
you disable it by either sending M561 in console, commenting out
M375 in config.g, or disabling it via the dropdown on the “Auto
Delta Calibration” button in DWC.
