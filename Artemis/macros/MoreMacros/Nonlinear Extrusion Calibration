; USAGE:
; Calibrate e-steps using free-air extrusion first. Set with M92.
; Go get the spreadsheet from this thread
;   https://forum.duet3d.com/topic/6015/guide-for-finding-the-values-for-m592-non-linear-extrusion/2
; Load filament and heat the hotend to the appropriate temperature for the filament
; Run this macro and record the actual extruded distance at each speed
; Enter distances into spreadsheet
; Use the values for "b" and "a" for the "B" and "A" parameters for M592
; Save that M592 command in your filament macro (along with pressure advance, retraction, etc)
; Run this macro again to see if things have improved?
